# ROBOTIC-UTILITY-VEHICLE
The Robotic Utility Vehicle (RUV) is a multi-purpose, autonomous or semi-autonomous ground vehicle designed to perform a variety of utility tasks across diverse environments. Engineered for adaptability, the RUV integrates advanced robotics, sensor technology, and AI-driven navigation to support applications such as material transport, inspection, surveillance, and remote operations in environments that may be hazardous or inaccessible to humans.

The vehicle is equipped with rugged, all-terrain mobility, modular attachments, and real-time communication systems. Key features include obstacle avoidance, GPS-assisted routing, remote control capability, and payload adaptability. Its autonomous functionality is powered by a combination of machine learning algorithms and sensor fusion (LiDAR, cameras, ultrasonic sensors) to ensure safe and efficient operation.

The RUV aims to enhance productivity, reduce human risk, and increase operational efficiency in sectors such as agriculture, defense, mining, logistics, and disaster response
